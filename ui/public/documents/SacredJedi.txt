L: Master Yoda.

Y: Young Skywalker.

L: I'm ending all of this. The tree, the text, the Jedi. I'm gonna burn it down.

[Yoda blasts the sacred texts with a force lightning bolt from beyond the grave.]

Y: Ah, Skywalker. Missed you, have I.

[Luke attempts to recover the texts from the burning tree as it explodes knocking him back.]

L: So it is time for the Jedi Order to end.

Y: Time it is. For you to look past a pile of old books, hmm?

L: The sacred Jedi texts.

Y: Oh. Read them, have you? Page-turners they were not. Yes, yes, yes. Wisdom they held, but that library contained nothing that the girl Rey does not already possess. Skywalker, still looking to the horizon. Never here, now, hmm? The need in front of your nose.

L: I was weak. Unwise.

Y: Lost Ben Solo, you did. Lose Rey, we must not.

L: I can't be what she needs me to be.

Y: Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness, folly, failure also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke, we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.
